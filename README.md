FIBONACCI

This is the beginning of the Fibonacci sequence: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, ...

The Fibonacci series starts with 0 and 1 (by definition). Each subsequent number is the sum of the previous two.

The fibonacci instance method in the Integer class returns the value of Fibonacci sequence corresponding to the integer it was called on. For example, `8.fibonacci()` should return 21 (remember, the first element in the sequence has an index of 0).

```ruby
> 8.cool_fibonacci()
> 21
```
