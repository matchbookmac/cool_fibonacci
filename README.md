(cool)FIBONACCI

This is the beginning of the Fibonacci sequence: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, ...

The Fibonacci series starts with 0 and 1 (by definition). Each subsequent number is the sum of the previous two.

Create a fibonacci instance method in the Integer class that returns the value of Fibonacci sequence corresponding to the integer it was called on. For example, 8.fibonaccishould return 21 (remember, the first element in the sequence has an index of 0). Implement this method with recursion.

Think about why it would take a long time to compute 100.fibonacci. If you try it, the program will take a really long time to run; you can press Ctrl + C to kill it.

Remember to alternate between writing unit tests and code.
